          <h2>Sol De Mexico</h2>
          <p> This casual sit-down Mexican spot in Craigin-Belmont looks kind of like an art gallery, with
            sculptures,
            paintings, and masks hanging all over. You'll find white tablecloths on all the tables and
            tissue
            paper
            accents
            on the plates, but the overall atmosphere is low-key, and it works for a casual weeknight dinner
            or
            laidback
            date. </p>
          <p> The menu changes regularly (four times a year, to be exact), and includes dishes you probably
            don't
            see
            all
            the
            time. Like papadzules - tasty corn tortillas filled with hard-boiled eggs, covered in pumpkin
            seed
            mole
            and
            a
            chili-habanero sauce. Or a perfectly cooked rabbit with a smoky guajillo salsa. That said, there
            are
            also
            staples you can always count on, like slightly sweet corn tamales in a spicy chicaca cream sauce
            (a
            must-order),
            and a tender rack of lamb in a delicious black mole. Speaking of mole, all the sauces here are
            fantastic,
            and,
            like Def Leppard's Pour Some Sugar On Me, improve just about everything. </p>

          <h2>Immm Rice& Beyond</h2>
          <p> You've probably been to a few restaurants where you wanted to order pretty much everything on
            the
            menu.
            But
            unless you were really hungry, rich, or both, that likely wasn't a feasible option. At Immm Rice
            &
            Beyond,
            it
            basically is - which is one reason we like this place so much. </p>
          <p> This is a casual BYOB spot in Uptown that specializes in Thai street food, and the menu is so
            extensive
            that
            it
            takes up a huge chalkboard wall. That's probably the first thing you'll notice when you walk in
            -
            and
            the
            second
            thing you'll notice is the steam table full of stews and curries, which smell like they've been
            developing
            flavor all day long (because, well, they have). </p>

          <h2>Chicago Cut</h2>
          <p> Chicago Cut is the steakhouse you visit for a Power Meal. A Power Meal could mean a few things,
            including a
            corporate dinner, special occasion, or even a big Saturday night out because you haven't had one
            in
            a
            while.
            And
            Chicago Cut is the king of Power Meals, because in a city full of fancy and expensive
            steakhouses,
            this
            is
            the
            most formal and expensive of the bunch. If you come expecting this, and are ready to spend on a
            serious
            meal,
            you'll have a great time. </p>
          <p> Chicago Cut is particularly suited to Power Meals when you take into account where it's located,
            right
            on
            the
            river at the base of an office building home to a top-level consulting company, a prestigious
            law
            firm
            where
            people get paid more than you, and Governor Rauner's private equity firm. These businesses make
            Chicago
            Cut
            a
            go-to spot for corporate cards, but know that it also gets a steady stream of locals and regular
            people
            looking
            for. </p>
